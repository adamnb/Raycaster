This is a dumb p3 program I made in high school for my trig class.
I'm actually rather proud of it, but I call it dumb because it's not very practical, given that p3 has its own builtin 3d renderer. 
I knew this at the time but I wanted to see if I could make a pseudo 3d renderer just using the knowledge of trigonometry I had aquired that very year and using very basic processing functionality.
